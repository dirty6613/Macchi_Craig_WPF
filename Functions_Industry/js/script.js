//I manage drivers and it is against the law for them to work over 60 hours in a 7 day week.  We must document their hours, mileage, and fuel.  This will assist with that process.


//function for driver input
function driverLog(hours, mileage, fuel){
	hours += hours;
	mileage += mileage;
	fuel += fuel;
}
